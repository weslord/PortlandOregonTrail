# The Portland, Oregon Trail

An historically accurate (set in 2008) remake (made in 2016) of a beloved classic (made in 1973) educational game (set in 1848).

Wrangle up an intrepid band of hipster adventurers at a poetry slam in Omaha Nebraska and set sail for the cooler pastures and fair trade organic coffee of Portland Oregon. In 2008. Before it was mainstream.
